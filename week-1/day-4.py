# Encapsulation
# Public Members
# Public members are variables or methods that can be accessed from anywhere inside the class, outside the class or from other modules. By default, all members in Python are public.
class Public:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "riddhi"  # Public attribute

# Protected members
# Protected members are variables or methods that are intended to be accessed only within the class and its subclasses. They are not strictly private but should be treated as internal.
class Protected:
    def __init__(self):
        self._age = 30  # Protected attribute

class Subclass(Protected):

# Private members
# Private members are variables or methods that cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. They are used to restrict access and protect internal data.
class Private:
